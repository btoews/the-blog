## The Blog CTF Challenge

The GitHub security team created this application as a challenge for the [2015 CSAW CTF](https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/) competition. This application contains several vulnerabilities. This application used to live at csaw2015-the-blog.herokuapp.com, but is no longer hosted online. Feel free to set this application up locally and try exploiting it. If you get stumped, you can find a writeup and exploit [here](solution.md).
